Title: Reggie's Linear Regression Model

Description
This project seeks to find the line of best fit for a set of given inputs (m, b, datapoints) per Codecademy's specifications for this python module.  

I completed this project off-platform using Jupyter Notebook and have pushed it to Github with the purposes of opening it to review and feedback.  Thank you for taking the time to look at my code! 

***I am new to coding and this process in general, so any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated.***
